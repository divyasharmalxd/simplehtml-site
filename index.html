            <h2>Understanding by Design</h2><br>
            <p>Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe are credited with originating the concept of "Understanding by Design," which involves the use of the instructional approach called "Backward Design" to organize courses and topic modules.</p>
            <p>This approach emphasizes the need of beginning with the desired outcomes in mind, and subsequently designing instructional activities and evaluations that would effectively accomplish those objectives.</p>
